 ## Hashtags
 ### Instructions - Hashtags
 - Build a `Restaurant` model object with `name`, `streetAddress`, `city`, `state`, and `reviews` properties.
 - Build a `Review` model object with a `username` and `text` property.
 - Instantiate an array of `Restaurant` and `Review` objects. Make sure that each `Restaurant` object holds an array of reviews. Add hashtags to some of your reviews or restaruant descriptions. (Use Yelp or Google to help you come up with `Restaurants` and `Reviews`).
 - Add a `hashtags` computed property to the `Restaurant` object that returns an array of any hashtags in the `Restaurant` or `Review`.
 `- Check your computed property by printing a list of hashtags of each review and restaurant.
 
 ### Instructions - Searching
 - Add a `SearchableObject` protocol with one function `matchesSearchTerm(searchTerm: String)`.
 - Implement the function on both model objects.
 - Demonstrate your search by printing a list of `Restaurants` that match a variety of search terms.
